TITLE: `STAFT' : module to fit flexible parametric accelerated failure time models.

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR: 

Description: staft fits flexible parametric accelerated failure time models using restricted cubic splines.
This can be thought of as an accelerated failure time formulation of the Royston-Parmar model (stpm2). staft 
can be used with single- or multiple-record or single- or multiple-failure st data. staft extends accelerated 
failure time models to allow time-dependent acceleration factors, using splines. Post-estimation tools are available.
